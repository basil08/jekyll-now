Where I struggle against the forces greater than me to decide what I want to do in life. 

Typical confusion phase. What is the root source of this confusion and dread? Poverty? Nurture methods? My birthplace? What am I afraid of? 

Typical dread and anxiety. Watching my peers run in this rat race. What if I am wrong? Yeah, so what? 

Am I late? 

I don;t think I'll do anything in life if I go about memorizing what is the colour of the ppt formed by addition of CdCO3 to a sulphide salt.

The fear of not having a job is so deeply etched into our minds and hearts by our forefathers that we simply refuse to come out and do what we truly love. And it is bullshit to try to dislodge the blame by saying that you haven't discovered what you love. Everyone does know somewhere down in their heart, maybe in a compromised corner or a room voluntarily locked by their anxious self, but it is there.   

But this nonsense should hardly be an alibi today. In 2020. What are your needs as an individual student? Very meagre. Will I not be able to sustain myself? 

What is stopping us is not the genuine fear of losing money. It is the fear of starting itself. We are too happy to be in that secure zone, doing what someone else tells us to, collecting our paychecks timely. Anything outside the conventional is dangerous. This is the bullshit we are brought up in.
