Where I struggle against the forces greater than me to decide what I want to do in life. 

Typical confusion phase. What is the root source of this confusion and dread? Poverty? Nurture methods? My birthplace? What am I afraid of? 

Typical dread and anxiety. Watching my peers run in this rat race. What if I am wrong? Yeah, so what? 

Am I late? 

I don;t think I'll do anything in life if I go about memorizing what is the colour of the ppt formed by addition of CdCO3 to a sulphide salt.
