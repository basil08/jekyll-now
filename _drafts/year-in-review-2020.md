## Abstract   

What a marvellous year this has been! The whole world united as a global community against one common miscreant. Everyone sharing everyone else's joys and sufferings. Governments getting toppled, new milestones being reached. A year most certainly going down in history as _unconventional_.     

But wait, this post is not about me philosophizing about the world. It's about me. On a personal level, I never had such an exhilarating year. Regrets, sufferings, oppurtunities, challenges, rewards, success, failure and of course, knowledge - all now muddled into a fuzzy warm tingling in my head.
