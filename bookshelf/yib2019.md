It was a pretty hectic year with me moving into new school and settling in. All the exams, etc. Anyway, I managed to sneak in some good stuff! :sweat_smile:  

....    

Hold tight!    

Perhaps, I am really busy with the obligations of society or stuff elders make us do to make them feel happy.   

Trust me, I want to write.
