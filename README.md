# Source for Personal Website    

This is the source repo for my personal website/blog.  

You can visit my blog [here](https://basil08.github.io).   

## Build your own

You can refer to these excellent articles which I used:    
1. [Amanda Viscounti's][amanda] basic introduction for the _absolute_ newbie at Programming Historian. 
2. [Steel Wagstaff's][steel] medium article discusses _other_ alternatives to hosting as GitHub pages (and a lot more).
3. [Barry Clark's][barry] article at Smashing Magazine (assumes some prerequisite knowledge).     

## Questions?
