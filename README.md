## Build your own

You can refer to these excellent articles which I used:    
1. [Amanda Viscounti's][amanda] basic introduction for the _absolute_ newbie at Programming Historian. 
2. [Steel Wagstaff's][steel] medium article discusses _other_ alternatives to hosting as GitHub pages (and a lot more).
3. [Barry Clark's][barry] article at Smashing Magazine (assumes some prerequisite knowledge).     

## Questions?
