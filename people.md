## Abstract   

People who have had some influence on me in some way or the other. And, some pioneers/experts in the fields I am interested in.   

They come in no particular order except the order in which they were discovered.     
 
Some of them are on Twitter too.   

## Go check them out! 

1. [Patrick Collison][pc]: The story of how I stumbled upon his blog is one of pure serendipity.  
2. [Bob Nystrom][bob]: I really like his attitude (and passion) towards teaching stuff.   
3. [Alexey Guzey][guzey]: Recently discovered.   
4. [Neil Kakkar][neil]: I often find myself drifting towards his blog. ;)      
5. [Russ Cox][russ]: I _love_ to dig ancient internet relics. Primarily because I wasn't there when it was built.    
6. [Ali Spittel][ali]: Self-taught software engineer with a passion to teach. Yes please!
7. [Peter Norvig][norvig]: PAIP. Enough said.    
8. [Remy Sharp][remy]: JS Developer. ZX, 6502 and other good stuff. And then, you know how much I love to shuffle through other people's bookshelves. :sweat_smile:
