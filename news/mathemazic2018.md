## Abstract   

Mathemazic is a private mathematics competition hosted by Mio Amore for pupils of grades 5 to 9 who are passionate about mathematics. The year 2018 saw more than 1500 students from 100 schools in West Bengal taking it on in a action-packed two-round elimination contest.    

I had the honour to be named the winner in class 9 category tied along with a friend of mine.   

Below you can find few newspaper clippings that I could procure.
