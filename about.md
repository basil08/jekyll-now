Hi there! 

I am **Basil Labib**. I am 17. I am a high school student and expect to graduate next year from [Birla High School](https://birlahighschool.com), Kolkata. 

I take keen interest in STEM in general and Computer Science in particular. I absolutely love Physics and Applied Mathematics. I also like Biology. I like challenges, academic or otherwise. 

I am a simple person. I don't lose my cool easily but cannot take bullshit indefinitely.   

I believe in making an impact where it matters the most.

I believe in letting knowledge be free for those who wish to acquire it.  

I would rather be in a quiet place with few meaningful people than in a loud place with a crowd.  

I am not a particularly fond sight to look at but I do good enough for a human being. I am _very_ quiet with other people around but I can be _really great_ company if _you_ start the conversation. 

I **can't stand** injustice and hypocrisy. I feel quite strongly for institutions and systems that most of us have grown up with. 

I believe that the mind is the most essential commodity and it must be treasured and employed. 

I idolize Aaron Swartz, Linus Torvalds among many others. I quote Aaron saying "I don't hold grudges. They are unproductive". No one could possibly have put it more eloquently. 

I am a perceptive person. I love to experiment with things (even if they are completely outside my domain). I like to look at a thing and ask questions which few others would ask. 


## Music
I like to listen to stuff which doesn't stick to my head and accompany me to examination halls(!). I think "Cocteau Twins" are the perfect band for me with their shimmering soundscapes and Liz's ethereal, indecipherable voice. Send me to an island with all the CT tracks and I'll live happily ever after. 

Other interests include (but are not limited to) ABBA, Fleet Foxes, The Beatles and Beethoven. 

## Reading  

I _love_ to read (and more importantly, learn). I prefer non-fiction (technical books are a bonus) but exquisite fiction is also welcome. I like to invest my time into something which will be fruitful in the end, or loosely, lead to my development. 

You can know about my reading endeavours [here](/bookshelf)
