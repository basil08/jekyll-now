## Abstract   

Inspired by Patrick Collison's luscious [bookshelf][bookshelf], this page is the list of books I have read in the current year (whichever year you are reading it). Most of these are plucked from other people's recommendation lists, popular choices, stuff I find interesting or just a random topic I want to learn about on a Saturday evening. Suggestions? Drop me a [line][mailto]!

1. Check out [my current reading][current].   

2. Care to peek into [my TBR][tbr]?   
  
3. My year in books: [2019][yib2019]!     

4. My year in books: [2018][yib2018]!
