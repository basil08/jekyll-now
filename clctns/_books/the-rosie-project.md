My first read this year (2020). I started just after taking the last of my annuals and I remember laughing hard. It's a romcom about a genetic professor suffering from Asperger's trying to find a wife. The `Wife Project` still gives me giggles. Oh and I remember picking this up after seeing it on [Bill Gate's to-read list][gates_read_list].
