My view on society


Where I ruminate about the Indian Education System in particular (its shortcomings, some merits (almost none) etc) and education in general. What it means to learn something? What is it we are actually pursuing? 
Meaning of education in the 21st century. Effects of digital revolution. Globalization etc. Where elders go wrong? 

Hypocrisy in education. Everyone wants something for themselves.

Mediocrity in school education. Made to chase marks not excellence. Effects on society at large.
