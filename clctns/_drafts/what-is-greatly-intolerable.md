## I intend to make this a short   

And what greatly pissed me off is when people (so frequently) ask me this question,
What do you want to become?
And I tell them my answer,
I don't know.
Which is as true an answer as they can possibly get. But what troubles me to no end is the reaction that ensues bordering on mistrust and associates.

The truth is majority of the people who are alive have outdated world views (or perhaps we are advancing too fast for human _______ to cope up). That question is inherently flawed. We live in a time when science is so interdisciplinary. Physics, math, cs, engineering even biology collaborate together these (needlessly to say, wondrous) days. What I want to do comprises at least 5 different "occupations". But who cares?

I understand some people know me better than I know myself but it is my request to you all to stop acting insensitive to me and registering yourself as loathsome in my opinion.
