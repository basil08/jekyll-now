## Abstract   

We continue on our excursion to make a Discord bot building on our previous post.  

<!--As we advance on our excursion to make our own Discord bot, I appreciate your patience to deem my posts worthy of your attention. :sweat_smile: -->

Building on:  

[A Discord Bot for my friends - Part 1][post1]   

* We had a quick recapitulation of the prerequsites, setup and verified our development environment.   

* Signed up for Discord, switched to Dev mode and created our first Discord Application instance.   

In this post, we are looking forward to:   

* Actually inviting a bot to our server.   

* Writing a ping-pong bot (the hello world of Discord bot, if you will) and making our bot online for the very first time!   

* Refactoring code to allow multiple commands and easier maintainence of bot.   

* Implement few API-less (commands which don't require the bot to call `fetch()`) commands.   

Let's get our hands dirty!
