Hi there! My name is **Basil Labib**. I am a high school student expected to graduate next year from [Birla High School][school], Kolkata, India.    

<!-- @TODO: Activate/setup jemoji on GitHub pages for :sweat_smile: to work... -->
I take keen interest in Computer Science (too many subfields to mention, hence the generic container! :sweat_smile:). I also love Physics, Mathematics and Biochemistry. I like challenges, academic or otherwise.    

### Reading

I _love_ to read books. And I read on anything and everything I find _interesting_. I prefer non-fiction (technical books are a bonus!) over fiction. I write reviews/reports on my readings [here][blog].
<!-- Am I writing too much in the basic introduction? -->
<!-- Heck, it's my site! -->

### Music   

[_Fleet Foxes_][foxes] is my favourite indie rock band. And I absolutely adore [_Cocteau Twins_][twins]. "Dream Pop" is the kind of music I enjoy.      

I hope you enjoy your way around here. Here are a few starters for you to hop around: 
1. [Some of my writings](/blog). 
2. [My bookshelf](/bookshelf).

## Contact me
